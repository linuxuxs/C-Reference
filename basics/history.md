C++ is a programming language, known for it's speed, flexibility, scalability, It's a procedual and object-oriented programming language also! It's a high level programming language.

C++ Is widely used in game development, as it's speed makes it very fast than the other programming language out there. Everything started in 1970, when Dennis Ritchie created the C programming language at Bell Labs, C is a great one, but it was slow, so Bjarne Stroustrup thought of creating C++ in 1979, at that time also known as "C with classes", but lately changed to "C++" in 1983, the "++" stands for the increment operator from C, which means "a better version of C".  In other words C++ is an extension of C.

This was a big step, he "invented C++, wrote its early definitions, and produced its firstimplementation [...] chose and formulated the design criteria for C++, designed all it major facilities, and was responsible for the processing of extension proposals in the C++ standards committee." 

In 1998, the first standard was C++98, a standard is like a version of it, each year there was changes, new implementation or new features added. The most significant standard was C++11, this was a major standard, added new features that changed the game. It is considered modern C++ after the 2011 standard (C++11), and before this, it is considered as classic c++.
